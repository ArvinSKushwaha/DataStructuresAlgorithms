# Data Structures and Algorithms

I have recently started my quest to master Data Structures and Algorithms with the help of the book [__*Introduction to Algorithms, 3e*__, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein](https://mitpress.ublish.com/book/introduction-algorithms). In the spirit of Open Source, I have decided to share my notes and implementations for the topic presented in the book as I work through it.

## Repository Structure

- `implementations/` - Contains a list of subdirectories with implementations of each algorithm and data structure (and associated tests) in multiple languages, along with a Makefile to build, run, and test the implementations. In the `README.pdf` for each subdirectory, notes on the topic can be found.

Remember, this repository will be updated as I progress through the book, so if you don't see something in here now, you are likely to find it at a later time.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome. If you notice errors or want to provide more notes on a topic, either create an issue or fork the repo and make a pull request and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!
